# 📊 Ecommerce Project

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce customer transactions to uncover purchasing behaviors, segment customers, and provide actionable insights that can drive targeted marketing strategies and customer retention initiatives.  

The project leverages **Python for data preparation and analysis**, and **Power BI for interactive visualization**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand customer purchasing behavior using transactional data.  
- Segment customers into meaningful groups using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis**.  
- Build dashboards to help business stakeholders monitor trends and identify high-value customers.  
- Automate repeatable workflows for scalability.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Power BI**: Power Query, DAX for data cleaning and transformations  
- **Excel/CSV**: Data storage and initial exploration

## 🔑 Key Steps & Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Imported transaction dataset (50,000+ rows).  
- Cleaned data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting negative/cancelled transactions.  
- Standardized data formats for consistency.  

### 2. RFM Analysis
- **Recency**: Days since last purchase.  
- **Frequency**: Number of transactions per customer.  
- **Monetary**: Total spending of each customer.  
- Calculated RFM scores and created customer tiers such as:
  - **Champions**: High frequency and high spenders.  
  - **Loyal Customers**: Repeat buyers with stable purchase history.  
  - **At Risk**: Customers whose activity is declining.  
  - **Dormant**: Inactive customers with no recent purchases.  

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of purchases across time, geography, and products.  
- Identification of seasonal sales trends.  
- Visualization of customer spend patterns.  

### 4. Dashboard Development
- Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** showing:
  - Customer segments by RFM score.  
  - Revenue contribution by product and region.  
  - Monthly/quarterly sales trends.  
  - Top products and customer lifetime value.  

### 5. Automation
- Developed a **Python script** to automate RFM calculations on new incoming data.  
- Reduced manual effort by ensuring the pipeline is reusable.  

---

## 📈 Insights & Outcomes
- Segmentation revealed that **15% of customers (“Champions”) contributed to ~45% of revenue**.  
- Seasonal peaks identified around November and December, indicating promotional opportunities.  
- “At Risk” and “Dormant” groups represented **30% of the customer base**, highlighting retention opportunities.  
- Automated workflows reduced analysis time by **30%**, improving efficiency.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Deploy a recommendation engine for product suggestions.  
- Perform cohort analysis to track customer retention over time.  
- Integrate advanced clustering techniques (K-means, DBSCAN) for deeper segmentation.
