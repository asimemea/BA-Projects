# 🏥 Healthcare Data Project

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes hospital operations data to evaluate patient care efficiency, safety, and resource utilization.  
The focus is on understanding the relationship between **bed occupancy rates, fall rates, and patient outcomes**, and using analytics to provide actionable insights for hospital management.  

Interactive dashboards were created in **Power BI** to monitor healthcare KPIs against benchmarks and support data-driven decision-making.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Assess hospital performance using operational and patient safety data.  
- Identify correlations between **bed occupancy, patient falls, and safety outcomes**.  
- Develop dashboards for real-time monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs).  
- Suggest data-driven operational improvements to enhance patient care.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**: Dashboard development, KPI visualization, Power Query, DAX  
- **SQL**: Data extraction and transformations  
- **Excel**: Data cleaning, validation, and quick analysis  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation and trend analysis

## 🔑 Key Steps & Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Collected and cleaned hospital data covering patient occupancy, admissions, discharges, and safety metrics.  
- Standardized date and patient ID formats for consistency.  
- Removed anomalies such as incomplete or duplicate entries.  

### 2. KPI Selection
Focused on key healthcare performance indicators:  
- **Bed Occupancy Rate (%)**  
- **Fall Rate per 1,000 Patient Days**  
- **Average Length of Stay (ALOS)**  
- **Patient Throughput**  

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- Conducted correlation analysis, e.g.:  
  - **Bed Occupancy Rate & Fall Rate – Strong positive correlation (0.70)**  
    → Higher occupancy increases staff workload, which can lead to more patient falls.  
- Derived actionable interpretations from each KPI relationship.  

### 4. Dashboard Development
- Built an **interactive Power BI dashboard** featuring:  
  - Trends in bed occupancy and fall rates over time.  
  - KPI benchmarks vs. target thresholds.  
  - Drill-down by department, ward, or time period.  
  - Automated measures using **DAX** for flexible reporting.  

### 5. Operational Insights
- High occupancy (>85%) often led to increased fall incidents.  
- Suggested increasing staffing ratios during peak periods to reduce patient safety risks.  
- Recommended **optimizing discharge planning** to free up capacity.

## 📈 Insights & Outcomes
- Achieved **clear visibility** into hospital KPIs via dashboards.  
- Identified **strong correlation (0.70)** between bed occupancy and fall rates, enabling proactive risk management.  
- Set a **target of maintaining 80–85% occupancy** to balance efficiency and patient safety.  
- Highlighted opportunities for better **staff allocation and patient monitoring** during high-demand periods.  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Expand dataset to include additional KPIs (e.g., readmission rates, infection control).  
- Introduce predictive analytics to forecast hospital demand.  
- Implement a **real-time data pipeline** for continuous monitoring.  
- Explore machine learning models to predict patient fall risks.
